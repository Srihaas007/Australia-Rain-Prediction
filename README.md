# Australian Weather Forecasting with Machine Learning

Accurate weather prediction is essential for various sectors, including agriculture, transportation, and disaster management. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning classification methods to enhance Australian weather forecasting by predicting the probability of rainfall using the 'weatherAUS.csv' dataset.

## Introduction

Weather forecasting plays a critical role in numerous sectors, influencing decision-making processes and resource management. Traditional meteorological methods have limitations in addressing complex and fluctuating weather data. This project aims to overcome these limitations by applying machine learning algorithms to classify weather patterns, specifically focusing on rainfall prediction.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is the 'Weather Dataset Rattle Package' available on Kaggle. This dataset provides comprehensive weather information recorded across various locations in Australia. It includes attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall, making it suitable for training machine learning models to predict rainfall probabilities.

## Code Implementation

The code implements several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, Gaussian naive Bayes, and MLP classifier. It follows a structured approach to data analysis and pre-processing, including exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and scaling. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, confusion matrices, and cross-validation accuracy. The models are assessed for underfitting and overfitting to ensure robustness and generalization.

## Conclusion

By applying machine learning algorithms to weather data, this project demonstrates the potential to improve Australian weather forecasting accuracy. The use of the 'Weather Dataset Rattle Package' from Kaggle provides a rich source of information for training and evaluating predictive models. Further advancements in machine learning techniques hold promise for enhancing weather prediction capabilities and supporting informed decision-making in various sectors.
